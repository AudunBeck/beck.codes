## Areas
- Focus
- Auto-pilot
- Aware
- Distracted (Free of Mind)

## Quadrants
### Flow
- Where time travel happens, where stuff gets done

### Mindful
- Where hard research and new things are learned

### Creative
- Where you freely explore new ideas

### Mindless
- Where your brain relaxes, zooms out and see the connections of it all.

## Thoughts
I believe that it is "cheapest" to allways go through *Mindless* when you are swapping between quadrants.
