## What do I need to prepare for flow?
Before I want to get into the flow state, I need to:
- Break down the task at hand to action points.
- Write down all pending thoughts, get them out of my head and onto paper.
- Double-check that no one will break my focus right away (message platforms).
- Turn my phone around, setting into "Do not disturb" mode.

## What keeps me out of flow?
"Not enough time to work on it"
- How do I solve this and convince myself to get something done?
- Should I keep a backlog of "small tasks"?
- Plan/block my day better. What is breaking in my plans? Note these down during shutdown.

## Areas
- Focus
- Auto-pilot
- Aware
- Distracted (Free of Mind)

## Quadrants
### Flow
- Where time travel happens, where stuff gets done

### Mindful
- Where hard research and new things are learned

### Creative
- Where you freely explore new ideas

### Mindless
- Where your brain relaxes, zooms out and see the connections of it all.

### Thoughts
I believe that it is "cheapest" to allways go through *Mindless* when you are swapping between quadrants.
