To reclaim my time from digital distractions I need to fill it with something to do.
Otherwise my brain will miss the *"no-energy-needed"* dopamine from doom-scrolling and looking at short-form content.

I know deep down that "one more video" on youtube about some obscure topic has 0 to no value to me, and that I will probably forget it in the next 24 hours.

### Digital Minimalism
Cal Newport argues in his book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515)
that you need high-quality alternatives to the internet's low-quality dopamine hits.
It is also argued that this leisure should be done offline or physically. And done for oneself only.

## What do I want to do?
As a person who spent a considerable amount of time gaming since a young age, I don't quite know what I'd like to do.
Sports never captured my attention.

I have begun to pick up lots of reading recently. I picked up a kindle,
and Brandon Sanderson's [Mistborn](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/the-mistborn-saga-the-original-trilogy)
trilogy after a recommendation from a good friend. Which threw me into reading fiction,
and later started me down books around focus and leadership.

### Things I want to try
- Fixing my worn clothes
- Writing for myself (and others?)
- Take deliberate time to just *think*
- Make my home a better place
- Photography sessions
