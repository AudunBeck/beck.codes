### February 2026
This year has started a bit weird. But now things are seeming to fall into place.

I have felt like I have taken a few steps back in what I do day to day. But luckily I have friends and colleagues that I can lean on to gather more knowledge on the topics I face. 

I have done some changes to my own homelab/selfhosted setups, as well as this site itself having moved from docker-compose to a podman setup (which I should write some about). 

AI has now moved into my sight for development, being a very good tool to use to quickly understand the inner workings of a new codebase. Having it look for specific functionality that I know exists, but that I do not know specifically what file it exists in has been to much help.

After a bit of a rough start to the year, I finally feel ready to embrace another great year head on!


### December 2024
This year could be summarized as "The Year of Growth" for me.

I have really deep-dived into how to better deliver as at a team scale. Forgoing specifically what makes *me* deliver better at my projects.
Rather looking at how the *team* can have a better work environment.
I also see myself lucky to work in an environment where I can jump on this opportunity to re-think how I wan't to solve problems.
The same environment I hope to be able to give and share with others.

I have also moved this site away from [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), to get a better understanding of what goes on in the background.
With my partner showing how to set up GitHub actions and Docker images from the ground up.

3d-Printing suddenly popped onto my radar as well. Picking up a small printer for small fixing projects at home, as well for my TTRPG addiction.
Planning to set of time in 2025 to pick up 3d modelling again, and peak into Fusion360(?)

I am going into 2025, feeling as ready as I could be.
I feel fulfilled in my work, and starting to find what I want to spend my free-time doing.
Now it's just to put down the time for it!

### September 2024
The last few months I have felt a change in what problems I try to solve.
Coming off of a binge of different books I have read lately, I have taken more interest in what ways of working the team excels in.
What communication is missing, and why it has happened.

Tech, and coding is still what drives me however, but I get excited when I solve other work-related issues as well.


I have gotten a bigger interest in setting up the digital tools I need myself.
Hoping to set up a proper backup solution, outside the old hard-drive chugging along in my desktop.
Understanding how the things I run work, such as the pipeline's for this webpage (currently),
as well as setting up the server for it, DNS, and such.

I just finished reading "How big things get done" by Bent Flyvberg,
and just started on "Sooner Safer Happier" Jonathan Smart, Zsolt Berend, Myles Ogilvie, Simon Rohrer

I also redid my home office, so it's easier to keep tidy, and giving me a better time and place to focus in.
